I built the app to track the hours I spend studying. I have been using a word file to this. I would create a table at the end of document and fill it as the week goes by. The document is now very long. I also do not like having to add the hours for the day and week manually. Lastly, I wanted to have a project for my portfolio built with Java backend.
